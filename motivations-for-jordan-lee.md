# Motivations for Jordan Lee to Replace Placeholder Content

## Current Placeholder Content Issues

### 1. Hardcoded User Name

**Location:** `src/App.tsx` line 205
**Current:** `const [user] = useState({ name: "Dave", isNewUser: false });`
**Issue:** The application displays "Dave" as the user name throughout the interface, which is clearly placeholder content.

### 2. Generic Persona Names in GTM Plan

**Location:** `src/App.tsx` around line 3918
**Current:** "Primary Persona: Emily Carter"
**Issue:** Using generic persona names instead of real user research data.
